# Custom Fonts

This directory hosts self-hosted font files that ship with the production build.

> **Note:** The Nanum Pen Script face is required for the `.font-kiya` utility. Download `NanumPenScript-Regular.ttf` from the Google Fonts repository and place it in this folder without committing the binary to git.
