# Security Policy

## Supported Versions


## Reporting a Vulnerability

This repository is provided as a starter template. The security guidance below helps template maintainers and downstream users set up a responsible disclosure and scanning workflow.

## Quick checklist for template users

- Replace any example security contact emails (`security@example.com`) with a real address that you monitor (or use your organisation's vulnerability intake process).
- Configure CI steps to run security linters and scanners (Snyk, npm-audit, Dependabot alerts, or other SCA tools) as appropriate. Document these steps in `README.md`.
- If you use third-party services (analytics, error trackers, auth providers), document what's collected and how to opt out in your privacy policy.

## For template maintainers & contributors

## Reporting a vulnerability (recommended)

If you discover a security issue in this template or a deployment derived from it:

- Prefer a private disclosure: send an email to the project's security contact (replace `security@example.com`) or open a private issue if the hosting provider supports it.
- If no private channel exists, open a public issue marked with a short title like `security: <short description>` and then follow up with a redacted example and remediation steps.

If you want, I can add a sample `.github/SECURITY.md` template and a `.env.example` showing the config keys that need safe handling.
