### Title
Add test coverage analyzer to DeepSource config

### Description
This issue tracks the work proposed in PR #162 (https://github.com/kiyarose/Portf/pull/162). This change adds automated test coverage reporting for both Swift and JavaScript/TypeScript projects, integrating coverage uploads to DeepSource. It introduces a new GitHub Actions workflow to generate LCOV reports for each language and updates the DeepSource configuration to recognize these reports.

### Key points:
- Adds a workflow (.github/workflows/lcov.yml) that runs tests and generates LCOV coverage reports for Swift and JavaScript/TypeScript and uploads to DeepSource.
- Updates .deepsource.toml to enable the test-coverage analyzer and specify report paths and formats for both languages.
