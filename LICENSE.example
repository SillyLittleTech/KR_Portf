This repository includes a default `LICENSE` file (BSD 3-Clause) that must be preserved in source redistributions.

Use this `LICENSE.example` as guidance before you change the active `LICENSE` file in your fork. Important: do not remove or replace the BSD-3-Clause notice or the original copyright
attribution to Kiya Rose (2025) when redistributing or publishing derived works unless you have explicit permission from the copyright holder.

1) Picking a license

- Permissive licenses (BSD, MIT, Apache 2.0): allow others to reuse and redistribute your code with few restrictions. Apache 2.0 adds an explicit patent grant.
- Copyleft licenses (GPL family): require downstream projects to publish derivative works under the same license.
- Creative Commons licenses are sometimes used for non-code assets (images, documentation) but are not recommended for source code.

Choose the license that aligns with how you want others to use and contribute to your project.

2) Editing `LICENSE`

- If you want to add your own copyright attribution in a fork, add your line below the original notice rather than replacing it.

  Example (do not remove the original):

  Copyright (c) 2025, Kiya Rose

- Update the `package.json` `license` field to match the chosen license identifier (for example, `"BSD-3-Clause"`, `"MIT"`, `"Apache-2.0"`, or `"GPL-3.0-only"`).

3) Preserving upstream attribution and notices

- If you redistribute modified code that includes code from other projects, preserve their license headers and notices as required by the original license.
- For BSD-3-Clause (the default here), keep the copyright notice, list of conditions, and disclaimer in source redistributions.

4) If you change the license

- Changing the license of a project you don't exclusively own may require permission from contributors or rights holders. If the template has many contributors, consider whether you need contributor consent.

5) Security & contributor tooling notes

- If you add security scanners, dependency checks, or other developer tooling that requires credentials, document the required environment variables in `.env.example` and do not commit secrets.
- If your license choice or contributor policies require Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) or DCO signoffs, add the necessary templates (`CLA.md` or a sign-off checklist) and document how contributors should sign.

6) Example quick steps to make the template your own

- Fork the repo.
- Update `LICENSE` (change copyright line and year).
- Update `README.md` and `public/index.html` with your site name and contact info.
- Replace `src/data/*` content with your portfolio data.
- Update `package.json` `name` and `license` fields.

Keep the active `LICENSE` file in the repo for legal clarity; this `LICENSE.example` is only guidance and should not replace the real `LICENSE` file in downstream forks.
