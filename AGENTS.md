# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` contains the application code: `sections/` owns page sections, `components/` provides shared UI, `data/` holds portfolio content, and `providers/` exposes the theme context.
- Tailwind styles live in `src/index.css`, utilities in `src/utils/`, and global config in `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, and `vite.config.ts`.
- `npm run build` outputs to `dist/`, which Firebase Hosting serves via `firebase.json`.
- `.github/workflows/` houses CI/CD pipelinesâ€”update them when scripts or deploy behavior changes.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` (or `npm ci` in CI) installs dependencies; rerun after adding libraries like Framer Motion or @dnd-kit.
- `npm run dev` launches Vite with hot reloading at http://localhost:5173.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint; keep the tree warning-free before opening a PR.
- `npm run build` compiles TypeScript and bundles the app for Firebase Hosting.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow Prettier defaults (two-space indent, trailing commas where supported). Use `npx prettier --check "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"` before committing.
- Components use PascalCase, hooks are camelCase, and Tailwind utility compositions live in the JSX className strings.
- Favor rounded Material-style surfaces (`rounded-3xl`, `shadow-card`) and translucent layers for depth.
- Never commit Firebase secrets; rely on `.env.local` or GitHub Secrets for credentials.

## Design & Interaction Guidelines
- Maintain the sleek, minimal aesthetic with rounded Material-style cards and soft shadows.
- Use rounded Material Symbols icons for navigation, social chips, and headers to keep iconography consistent.
- Drive animations with Framer Motion; always respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and provide sensible fallbacks.
- Ensure the light/dark mode toggle retains the animated sun/moon icons and that both themes meet contrast guidelines.

## Testing Guidelines
- Co-locate tests beside components as `<name>.test.tsx` or under `src/tests/`.
- Once tests exist, wire them to `npm test` and enforce them in CI before `npm run build`.
- Capture Lighthouse or visual diffs for UI-heavy changes and attach them to PRs.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Keep commit messages short and imperative (`Add education timeline`, `Polish theme toggle`).
- PRs should include a summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI updates, and the Firebase preview URL surfaced by CI.
- Validate `npm run lint` and `npm run build` locally before requesting review.

## Firebase Hosting Tips
- Use `firebase emulators:start --only hosting` to preview rewrites and headers locally.
- Prefer GitHub Actions for deploys; reserve manual `firebase deploy --only hosting` for emergencies so release history stays auditable.
