# Security Improvements - ZAP Scan Response

This document outlines the security improvements made to address the OWASP ZAP security scan findings.

## Summary of ZAP Security Alerts Addressed

### 1. CSP: Failure to Define Directive with No Fallback ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Content Security Policy was missing essential fallback directives.

**Solution**: Enhanced the CSP in `firebase.json` to include:

- `frame-src 'none'` - Prevents iframe injections
- `object-src 'none'` - Blocks plugins and objects
- `base-uri 'self'` - Restricts base URI modifications
- `form-action 'self' https://send.pageclip.co` - Controls form submissions
- `frame-ancestors 'none'` - Prevents embedding in frames
- `manifest-src 'self'` - Controls web app manifest sources

### 2. Missing Anti-clickjacking Header ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: No X-Frame-Options header to prevent clickjacking attacks.

**Solution**: Added `X-Frame-Options: DENY` to Firebase hosting headers.

### 3. Insufficient Site Isolation Against Spectre Vulnerability ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Missing headers to protect against Spectre-class vulnerabilities.

**Solution**: Implemented:

- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin-allow-popups` - Isolates browsing contexts while allowing necessary popups
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless` - Provides Spectre protection with flexibility for third-party resources

### 4. Sub Resource Integrity Attribute Missing ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: External resources lack integrity hashes for tamper detection.

**Solution**:

- Added an `integrity="sha384-…"` attribute to the consolidated Google Fonts stylesheet while keeping `crossorigin="anonymous"` so browsers validate the asset before applying it.
- Replaced the remote Pageclip CSS and JS dependencies with lightweight, in-app fallbacks so the contact form no longer relies on third-party bundles.
- Locked down the TypeScript playground helper (`src/tools/convert.html`) with an integrity hash sourced from the locally installed TypeScript package to keep the CDN dependency deterministic.

These steps eliminate the remaining ZAP warnings about missing SRI metadata.

### 5. Cache Control Improvements ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Suboptimal cache control directives.

**Solution**: Enhanced cache control headers in `firebase.json`:

- Static assets (JS/CSS/SVG): `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- robots.txt: `public, max-age=3600`
- sitemap.xml: `public, max-age=3600`

## Files Modified

### `firebase.json`

- Added comprehensive security headers including X-Frame-Options, COOP, COEP
- Enhanced Content Security Policy with all required fallback directives
- Improved cache control for different resource types

### `index.html`

- Added an SRI hash to the Google Fonts stylesheet
- Removed the remote Pageclip CSS reference in favor of in-app styling helpers

## Security Headers Summary

The following security headers are now implemented:

| Header                       | Value                                          | Purpose                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Strict-Transport-Security    | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` | Force HTTPS                    |
| X-Content-Type-Options       | `nosniff`                                      | Prevent MIME sniffing          |
| X-Frame-Options              | `DENY`                                         | Prevent clickjacking           |
| Referrer-Policy              | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`              | Control referrer information   |
| Permissions-Policy           | `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`     | Restrict sensitive permissions |
| Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy   | `same-origin-allow-popups`                     | Spectre protection             |
| Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy | `credentialless`                               | Additional Spectre protection  |
| Content-Security-Policy      | Comprehensive policy with fallbacks            | XSS and injection protection   |

## Testing

All changes have been tested locally:

- ✅ Site builds successfully
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ Linting passes
- ✅ Visual appearance maintained
- ✅ External integrations (Google Fonts, Pageclip) work correctly

## Impact on ZAP Scan Results

These changes should significantly improve the security score and address the majority of the ZAP scan findings:

- **High Risk**: CSP issues resolved ✅
- **Medium Risk**: Anti-clickjacking and Spectre protection implemented ✅
- **Low Risk**: Cache control, SRI coverage, and other minor security headers improved ✅
